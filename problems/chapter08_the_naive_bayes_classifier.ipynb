    "**1. Personal Loan Acceptance.** The file `UniversalBank.csv` contains data on 5000 customers of Universal Bank. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (=9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign. In this exercise, we focus on two predictors: Online (whether or not the customer is an active user of\n",
