    "**1. Personal Loan Acceptance.** The file `UniversalBank.csv` contains data on 5000 customers of Universal Bank. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (=9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign. In this exercise, we focus on two predictors: Online (whether or not the customer is an active user of\n",

Although they are not equal, both would lead to exactly the same classification for a cutoff of 0.5 (and many other values). It is often the case that the rank ordering of probabilities is even closer to the exact Bayes method than the probabilities themselves, and for classification purposes it is the rank orderings that matter."
