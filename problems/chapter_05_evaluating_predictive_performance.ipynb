    "The following table shows the mentioned data mining routine confusion matrix that was applied to a total of 1040  (952 + 88) records. The two diagonals cells (upper left, lower right) give the number of correct classifications - where the predicted class coincide with the actual class. The off-diagonal cells give counts of misclassification.\n",

    "2. Suppose that this routine has an adjustable cutoff (threshold) mechanism by which you can alter the proportion of records classified as fraudulent. Describe how moving the cutoff up or down would affect\n",

    "a. the classification error rate for records that are truly fraudulent\n",
    "\n",
    "R> Assuming that the default cutoff for this classifier is 0.5, we have a record classified as fraudulent if the estimated probability is greater than 0.5, otherwise it is classified as a non-fraudulent. If we instead adopt another cutoff, say 0.25, we will classify much more records as fraudulent and the classification rate might go up because will comprise more non-fraudulent misclassified as fraudulent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if we adopt a cutoff of 0.75, we instead classify fewer records as fraudulent and again the misclassification might go up. It is a good practice to empirically identify the best cutoff and validate with an expert to see with the cutoff threshold holds. To see the entire range of cutoff values and how the accuracy or misclassification rates change as a function of the cutoff, we can plot the performance measure of interest vs. the cutoff.\n",

    "3. FiscalNote is a startup founded by a Washington, DC entrepreneur and funded by a Singapore sovereign wealth fund, the Winklevoss twins of Facebook fame, and others. It uses machine learning and data mining techniques to predict for its clients whether legislation in the US Congress and in US state legislatures will pass or not. The company reports 94% accuracy.

    "R> This link gives a very good overview about bills and US Congress: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning the misclassification question, we can think about the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of misclassification: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Null hypothesis: bill not passed\n",
    "- Alternate hypothesis: the bill passed\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "    1) Type 1 error (known also as False Positive): It is a condition when the bill is not passed actually but the system predicts that the bill is to be passed\n",
    "\n",
    "    2) Type 2 error (known also as False Negative): It is a condition when the bill is passed actually but the system predicts that the bill is no passed\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of the errors (and the correct guesses) can be summarized in a confusion matrix. To asses whether the system is making good predictions we can use the *propensities* - the probability estimation by an algorithm belongs to a given class (or classes). Propensities are typically used either as an interim step for generating predicted class membership (classification), or for rank-ordering the records by their probability of belonging to a class of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "If overall classification accuracy (involving all the classes) is of interest, the record can be assigned to the class with the highest probability. Using this technique, it is possible to find the best cutoff that gives the best accuracy for the bill system."
